# AWS Gameservers

An experimental CDK Construct library.

## Statement of Intent

This is a (future) collection of L3 CDK Constructs that represent opinionated, *static* EC2 deployments.  
  
Users should expect features such as automated backup and restore of dedicated servers, parking schedules (to save cost), and simplified game server config.
